# Java-ATM-Project
This project is a console-based ATM simulation system written in Java. It allows users to log in with a customer number and PIN, and perform typical banking operations such as:

Check Balance (Checking & Savings account)
Deposit Money
Withdraw Money
Switch between Checking and Savings accounts
Exit

The project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, and is a great example for beginners learning Java.

# Features:
